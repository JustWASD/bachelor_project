## Description

## Todo
* "while mood_update == 0" waiting sucks. Basically, I need to wait for the button input but I dont want to be stuck. Errors: If, while waiting for the button, messages are sent, all of the fire at once after the button press
* Security! Check the IDs and only answere if they are in the list of UserIDs we trust. Or something like that

## What's (kinda) working 
* /update opens a window with two buttons and closes after one button is pressed + it send info at the user. 
* /start
* multithreading tkinter and the telegram bot
* sending a message to a user with the telegram.bot
* opening and closing multiple tkinter windows in fullscreen
